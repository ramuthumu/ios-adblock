block every add in your iphone even the adds with in the app
To use a PAC file to block ads on an iPhone, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the "Settings" app on your iPhone.
2. Tap on "Wi-Fi" and connect to a Wi-Fi network.
3. Tap on the "i" icon next to the network name to access the network settings.
4 Scroll down and tap on "Configure Proxy."
5. Choose "Automatic" and enter the URL for the PAC file in the "URL" field. You can use the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramuthumu/ios-adblock/master/iadblock.pac
6 Tap on "Save" to apply the settings.

Once you have followed these steps, the PAC file will automatically block most intrusive ads on your iPhone not only in Safari but also within apps. Please note that not all ads may be blocked by this PAC file, as ad-blocking can be a cat-and-mouse game between advertisers and ad-blockers. Also, this method may not work for all apps, as some apps may not use the system proxy settings.
